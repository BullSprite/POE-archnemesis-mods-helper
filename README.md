# POE-archnemesis-mods-helper
I tried to create useful app to track your mods and see recipes considering mods you already has.

## App still have a lot of bugs, not all mods are in the folder to detect, a lot of functionality not implemented yet.
## The app only for Windows and screen resolution 1920x1080.

## Instalation file will be added later

### How to run the app now:
You need to install python 3.9.10.


Than install all dependencies from requirments.txt.


Use `pip -r install requirments.txt` in project folder for it.


Than run app.py with python.

### How to use:
After run the app you will see main window with search for recipe bar and button.

Also you will see scan button.

To scan your mods open them in POE and press scan button.

```diff
- Now the ' key binded to use scan, but thist must be improved, works not stable
```

After scan you will see your mods and their names.

Press save button to save your inventory, if some mods not detected you need to fill them. Also can ve not correct detections.

After save, recipes will show recipe considering your inventory. 

```diff
- Works still with some strange moments will fix in nearest future.
```

Fill free to write your suggestions and advices.
